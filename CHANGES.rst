==========
Change Log
==========

This log shows interesting changes that happen for each version, latest
versions first. It can be assumed that translations have been updated each
release, and any new translations added.

5.6 (unreleased)
================

- Make DRF CountryField respect ``blank=False``. This is a backwards incompatible change since blank input will now
  return a validation error (unless ``blank`` is explicitly set to ``True``).

- Fix ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`` when using the complex dictionary format and a single name.

- Add bandit to the test suite for basic security analysis.


5.5 (11 September 2019)
=======================

- Django 3.0 compatibility.

- Plugin system for extending the ``Country`` object.


5.4 (11 August 2019)
====================

- Renamed Macedonia -> North Macedonia.

- Fix an outlying ``makemigrations`` error.

- Pulled in new translations which were provided but missing from previous
  version.

- Fixed Simplified Chinese translation (needed to be ``locale/zh_Hans``).

- Introduce an optional complex format for ``COUNTRIES_ONLY`` and
  ``COUNTRIES_OVERRIDE`` to allow for multiple names for a country, a custom
  three character code, and a custom numeric country code.


5.3.3 (16 February 2019)
========================

- Add test coverage for Django Rest Framework 3.9.


5.3.2 (27 August 2018)
======================

- Tests for Django 2.1 and Django Rest Framework 3.8.


5.3.1 (12 June 2018)
====================

- Fix ``dumpdata`` and ``loaddata`` for ``CountryField(multiple=True)``.


5.3 (20 April 2018)
===================

- Iterating a ``Countries`` object now returns named tuples. This makes things
  nicer when using ``{% get_countries %}`` or using the country list elsewhere
  in your code.


5.2 (9 March 2018)
==================

- Ensure Django 2.1 compatibility for ``CountrySelectWidget``.

- Fix regression introduced into 5.1 when using Django 1.8 and certain queryset
  lookup types (like ``__in``).


5.1.1 (31 January 2018)
=======================

- Fix some translations that were included in 5.1 but not compiled.


5.1 (30 January 2018)
=====================

* Tests now also cover Django Rest Framework 3.7 and Django 2.0.

* Allow for creating country fields using (valid) alpha-3 or numeric codes.

* Fix migration error with blank default (thanks Jens Diemer).

* Add a ``{% get_countries %}`` template tag (thanks Matija ÄŒvrk).


5.0 (10 October 2017)
=====================

* No longer allow ``multiple=True`` and ``null=True`` together. This causes
  problems saving the field, and ``null`` shouldn't really be used anyway
  because the country field is a subclass of ``CharField``.


4.6 (16 June 2017)
==================

* Add a ``CountryFieldMixin`` Django Rest Framework serializer mixin that
  automatically picks the right field type for a ``CountryField`` (both single
  and multi-choice).

* Validation for Django Rest Framework field (thanks Simon Meers).

* Allow case-insensitive ``.by_name()`` matching (thanks again, Simon).

* Ensure a multiple-choice ``CountryField.max_length`` is enough to hold all
  countries.

* Fix inefficient pickling of countries (thanks Craig de Stigter for the report
  and tests).

* Stop adding a blank choice when dealing with a multi-choice ``CountryField``.

* Tests now cover multiple Django Rest Framework versions (back to 3.3).

4.6.1
-----

* Fix invalid reStructuredText in CHANGES.

4.6.2
-----

* Use transparency layer for flag sprites.


4.5 (18 April 2017)
===================

* Change rest framework field to be based on ``ChoiceField``.

* Allow for the rest framework field to deserialize by full country name
  (specifically the English name for now).


4.4 (6 April 2017)
==================

* Fix for broken CountryField on certain models in Django 1.11.
  Thanks aktiur for the test case.

* Update tests to cover Django 1.11


4.3 (29 March 2017)
===================

* Handle "Czechia" translations in a nicer way (fall back to "Czech Republic"
  until new translations are available).

* Fix for an import error in Django 1.9+ due to use of non-lazy ``ugettext`` in
  the django-countries custom admin filter.

* Back to 100% test coverage.


4.2 (10 March 2017)
===================

* Add sprite flag files (and ``Country.flag_css`` property) to help minimize
  HTTP requests.


4.1 (22 February 2017)
======================

* Better default Django admin filter when filtering a country field in a
  ``ModelAdmin``.

* Fix settings to support Django 1.11

* Fix when using a model instance with a deferred country field.

* Allow ``CountryField`` to handle multiple countries at once!

* Allow CountryField to still work if Deferred.

* Fix a field with customized country list. Thanks pilmie!


4.0 (16 August 2016)
====================

Django supported versions are now 1.8+

* Drop legacy code

* Fix tests, 100% coverage

* IOS / OSX unicode flags function

* Fix widget choices on Django 1.9+

* Add ``COUNTRIES_FIRST_SORT``. Thanks Edraak!

3.4 (22 October 2015)
=====================

* Extend test suite to cover Django 1.8

* Fix XSS escaping issue in CountrySelectWidget

* Common name changes: fix typo of Moldova, add United Kingdom

* Add ``{% get_country %}`` template tag.

* New ``CountryField`` Django Rest Framework serializer field.

3.4.1
-----

* Fix minor packaging error.


3.3 (30 Mar 2015)
=================

* Add the attributes to ``Countries`` class that can override the default
  settings.

* CountriesField can now be passed a custom countries subclass to use, which
  combined with the previous change allows for different country choices for
  different fields.

* Allow ``COUNTRIES_ONLY`` to also accept just country codes in its list
  (rather than only two-tuples), looking up the translatable country name from
  the full country list.

* Fix Montenegro flag size (was 12px high rather than the standard 11px).

* Fix outdated ISO country name formatting for Bolivia, Gambia, Holy See,
  Iran, Micronesia, and Venezuela.


3.2 (24 Feb 2015)
=================

* Fixes initial iteration failing for a fresh ``Countries`` object.

* Fix widget's flag URLs (and use ensure widget is HTML encoded safely).

* Add ``countries.by_name(country, language='en')`` method, allowing lookup of
  a country code by its full country name. Thanks Josh Schneier.


3.1 (15 Jan 2015)
=================

* Start change log :)

* Add a ``COUNTRIES_FIRST`` setting (and some other related ones) to allow for
  specific countries to be shown before the entire alphanumeric list.

* Add a ``blank_label`` argument to ``CountryField`` to allow customization of
  the label shown in the initial blank choice shown in the select widget.

=================

* Add ``COUNTRIES_ONLY`` setting to restrict to a specific list of countries.

  were causing a notable performance impact.

* PyUCA integration, allowing for more accurate sorting across all locales.
  Also, a better sorting method when PyUCA isn't installed.

* Better tests (now at 100% test coverage).

* Add a ``COUNTRIES_FLAG_URL`` setting to allow custom flag urls.

* Support both IOC and numeric country codes, allowing more flexible lookup of
  countries and specific code types.

* Field descriptor now returns ``None`` if no country matches (*reverted in
  v3.0.1*)

3.0.1 (27 Oct 2014)
-------------------
