Nullable `CountryField` (with `null=True`) now returns `None` instead of `Country(code=None)` when the database value is NULL. This makes the nullability explicit at the field level rather than inside the `Country` object, resulting in cleaner typing where `Country.code` is always a `str` (never `None`).

**Breaking change:** Code that previously checked `obj.country.code is None` should now check `obj.country is None`. The common pattern `if obj.country:` continues to work unchanged.
