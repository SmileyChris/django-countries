Add `COUNTRIES_FIRST_BY_LANGUAGE` and `COUNTRIES_FIRST_AUTO_DETECT` settings for dynamic country ordering based on user language. Countries can now be automatically reordered based on the current language, with locale-based auto-detection (e.g., `fr-CA` users see Canada prepended to the French country group).
