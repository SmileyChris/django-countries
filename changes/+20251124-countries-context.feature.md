Add `countries_context()` context manager for temporary, thread-local override of country configuration options. Supports all country options (`first`, `only`, `first_sort`, `first_repeat`, `first_break`, `first_by_language`, `first_auto_detect`), enabling per-request customization based on user preferences, IP geolocation, or other dynamic factors. Each option independently overrides its corresponding setting with the highest priority.
